# aws-iam-agent

An AI-powered AWS IAM agent built with LangChain and GPT-4. Ask questions about your AWS IAM setup in plain English and get live, accurate answers.

## What it does

Instead of writing one-off CLI scripts or digging through the AWS console, just ask:

The agent figures out which AWS API calls to make, executes them in real time, and returns a plain English answer.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_iam_users()` | All users — UserName, UserId, ARN |
| `list_iam_roles()` | All roles and ARNs |
| `list_iam_policies()` | Customer-managed policies only |
| `get_user_policies(username)` | Attached + inline policies for a user |
| `get_role_policies(role_name)` | Attached + inline policies for a role |
| `get_policy_document(policy_arn)` | Full JSON permission document |
| `list_access_keys(username)` | Key IDs, status, creation date |

## Installation

### download via pip

```bash
pip3 install aws-iam-agent
```


### Via Homebrew (some users are facing issues, actively working on it)

```bash
brew tap sujay2306/aws-iam-agent
brew install sujay2306/aws-iam-agent/aws-iam-agent
```


## Setup

Create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

> **Security**: Use an IAM user with `IAMReadOnlyAccess` only. Never grant write access to an LLM-controlled credential.

## Usage

```bash
aws-iam-agent
```

```

You: what policies does terraform-admin have?
